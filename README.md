# 🧼 Gonzo Products SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Natural solutions for a cleaner, fresher world.”

Welcome to the **Gonzo Products SDS / MSDS Documentation** repository! This community-driven project collects, organizes, and shares Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Gonzo Natural Magic products. Our mission is to make chemical safety information accessible, structured, and useful for families, educators, researchers, first responders, and developers.

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are standardized documents that provide detailed information about the hazards, composition, handling, and emergency measures related to chemical products. These documents are essential for:

- 🧪 Understanding chemical ingredients and their risks
- ⚠️ Identifying hazards and safety precautions
- 🚑 Responding to emergencies and exposures
- 🧹 Ensuring safe handling and storage

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

While Gonzo Products publishes SDS and MSDS on their website, these documents are often scattered across individual product pages. This repository aims to:

- **Centralize** all available SDS and MSDS for Gonzo products
- **Convert** them into machine-readable formats (JSON, YAML, CSV)
- **Enhance** accessibility for developers, AI researchers, and safety professionals
- **Support** education and emergency response efforts
